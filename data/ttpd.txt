I was supposed to be sent away, but they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic till nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say, I hope you're okay, but you're the reason
And no one here's to blame, but what about your quiet treason?

And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers
I wanna kill her

All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February
I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you
But I touched you

And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers
I wanna kill her

And for a fortnight there, we were together
Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
My husband is cheating
I wanna kill him

I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you
I touched you

I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you
I touched you

Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up
Another fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida, buy the car you want
But it won't start up till you touch, touch, touch me

Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up
Another fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida, buy the car you want
But it won't start up till I touch, touch, touch you


You left your typewriter at my apartment
Straight from the Tortured Poets Department
I think some things I never say
Like, "Who uses typewriters anyway?" But
You're in self-sabotage mode, throwing spikes down on the road
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
Who else decodes you?

And who's gonna hold you like me?
And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said
"You're not Dylan Thomas
I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel
We're modern idiots"
And who's gonna hold you like me?
Nobody
No-fucking-body
Nobody

You smoked then ate seven bars of chocolate
We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist
I scratch your head, you fall asleep
Like a tattooed golden retriever
But you awaken with dread, pounding nails in your head
But I've read this one where you come undone
I chose this cyclone with you

And who's gonna hold you like me? (Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)
And who's gonna know you like me? (Who's gonna know you?)
I laughed in your face and said
"You're not Dylan Thomas
I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel
We're modern idiots"
And who's gonna hold you like me? (Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)
No-fucking-body (Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)
Nobody (Who's gonna hold you? Gonna love you? Gonna troll you?)
Nobody

Sometimes I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me
But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave
And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen
Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be
'Cause we're crazy
So tell me
Who else is gonna know me?
At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger and put it on the one
People put wedding rings on, and that's the closest I've come
To my heart exploding

Who's gonna hold you?
Me
Who's gonna know you?
Me
"And you're not Dylan Thomas
I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel
We're two idiots"
Who's gonna hold you?

Who's gonna hold you? (Who's gonna hold you?)
Who's gonna hold you? (Who's gonna hold you?)
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you? Gonna know you? Gonna troll you?

You left your typewriter at my apartment
Straight from the Tortured Poets Department
Who else decodes you?


Oh, here we go again
The voices in his head
Called the rain to end our days of wild
The sickest army doll
Purchased at the mall
Rivulets descend my plastic smile

But you should've seen him
When he first got me

My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
I'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
'Cause it fit too right
Puzzle pieces in the dead of night
I should've known it was a matter of time
Oh, oh, my boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh-oh-oh

There was a litany of reasons why
We could've played for keeps this time
I know I'm just repeating myself
Put me back on my shelf
But first, pull the string
And I'll tell you that he runs
Because he loves me (He loves me)

'Cause you should've seen him
When he first saw me

My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
I'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
'Cause I knew too much
There was danger in the heat of my touch
He saw forever so he smashed it up
Oh, oh, my boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh-oh-oh

Once I fix me, he's gonna miss me
Once I fix me, he's gonna miss me

Just say when, I'd play again
He was my best friend
Down at the sandlot
I felt more when we played pretend
Than with all the Kens
'Cause he took me out of my box
Stole my tortured heart
Left all these broken parts
Told me I'm better off
But I'm not
I'm not
I'm not


Did you really beam me up?
In a cloud of sparkling dust
Just to do experiments on
Tell me I was the chosen one
Show me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from
For a moment, I knew cosmic love

Now I'm down bad, crying at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance
"Fuck it if I can't have him"
"I might just die, it would make no difference"
Down bad, waking up in blood
Staring at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up
I might stay down bad

Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him

Did you take all my old clothes?
Just to leave me here naked and alone
In a field in my same old town
That somehow seems so hollow now
They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about the existence of you
For a moment, I was heaven struck

Now I'm down bad, crying at the gym (Crying at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
"Fuck it if I can't have him" (Fuck it if I can't have him)
"I might just die, it would make no difference"
Down bad, waking up in blood (Waking up in blood)
Staring at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up
I might stay down bad

Like I lost my twin
Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad)
Down bad
Waving at the ship
Fuck it if I can't have him

I loved your hostile takeovers
Encounters closer and closer
All your indecent exposures
How dare you say that it's-
I'll build you a fort on some planet
Where they can all understand it
How dare you think it's romantic
Leaving me safe and stranded
'Cause fuck it, I was in love
So fuck you if I can't have us
'Cause fuck it, I was in love

Now I'm down bad, crying at the gym (Crying at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
"Fuck it if I can't have him" (Can't have him)
"I might just die, it would make no difference"
Down bad, waking up in blood (Waking up in blood)
Staring at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up
I might stay down bad

Like I lost my twin
Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad)
Down bad
Waving at the ship
Fuck it if I can't have him

Like I lost my twin
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad
Waving at the ship
Fuck it if I can't have him


So long, London (So long, London)
So long, London (So long, London)
So long, London (So long, London)

I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist
I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift
Pulled him in tighter each time he was drifting away
My spine split from carrying us up the hill
Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill
I stopped trying to make him laugh, stopped trying to drill the safe
Thinking how much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?
Oh, the tragedy

So long, London
You'll find someone

I didn't opt in to be your odd man out
I founded the club she's heard great things about
I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath
I stopped CPR, after all, it's no use
The spirit was gone, we would never come to
And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free

For so long, London
Stitches undone
Two graves, one gun
I'll find someone

And you say I abandoned the ship
But I was going down with it
My white-knuckle dying grip
Holding tight to your quiet resentment
And my friends said it isn't right to be scared
Every day of a love affair
Every breath feels like rarest air
When you're not sure if he wants to be there
So how much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?
How much tragedy?
Just how low did you think I'd go
Before I'd self-implode?
Before I'd have to go be free?

You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?
I died on the altar waiting for the proof
You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days
And I'm just getting color back into my face
I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place

For so long, London (So long, London)
Had a good run (Had a good run)
A moment of warm sun (Moment of warm sun)
But I'm not the one (I'm not the one)

So long, London (So long, London)
Stitches undone (Stitches undone)
Two graves, one gun (Two graves, one gun)
You'll find someone (You'll find)


I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you to cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
Clutching their pearls, sighing, "What a mess"
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you

Too high a horse
For a simple girl to rise above it
They slammed the door on my whole world
The one thing I wanted

Now I'm running with my dress unbuttoned
Screaming, "But Daddy, I love him!
I'm having his baby"
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm telling him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy but he's the one I want

Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
Growing up precocious sometimes means not growing up at all
He was chaos, he was revelry
Bedroom eyes like a remedy
Soon enough the elders had convened
Down at the city hall

"Stay away from her"
The saboteurs protested too much
Lord knows the words we never heard
Just screeching tires and true love

And I'm running with my dress unbuttoned
Screaming, "But Daddy, I love him!
I'm having his baby"
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm telling him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy but he's the one I want

I'll tell you something right now
I'd rather burn my whole life down
Than listen to one more second of all this bitching and moaning
I'll tell you something about my good name
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing

God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what's best for me
Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
Thinking it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me
And counteract the chemistry
And undo the destiny
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all this wild joy
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise
And it's just my choice

There's a lot of people in town that I
Bestow upon my fakest smiles
Scandal does funny things to pride
But brings lovers closer
We came back when the heat died down
Went to my parents and they came around
All the wine moms are still holding out
But fuck 'em, it's over

Now I'm dancing in my dress in the sun, and
Even my daddy just loves him
I'm his lady
And oh my God, you should see your faces
Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
And no, you can't come to the wedding
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

I'll tell you something right now, you ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
He was chaos, he was revelry
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice

Screaming, "But Daddy, I love him!
I'm having his baby"
No, I'm not, but you
Should see your faces
But oh my God, you should see your faces
He was chaos, he was revelry


Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
Fresh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
Fresh out the slammer, oh

Another summer, takin' cover
Rollin' thunder, he don't understand me
Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter
He was with her in dreams
Gray and blue and fights and tunnels
Handcuffed to the spell I was under
For just one hour of sunshine
Years of labor, locks and ceilings
In the shade of how he was feelin'
But it's gonna be alright, I did my time

Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
Fresh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
Fresh out the slammer, oh

Camera flashes, welcome bashes
Get the matches, toss the ashes off the ledge
As I said in my letters, now that I know better
I will never lose my baby again
My friends tried but I wouldn't hear it
Watched me daily disappearing
For just one glimpse of his smile
All those nights you kept me going
Swirled you into all of my poems
Now we're at the starting line, I did my time

Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin'
To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams
To the one who says I'm the girl of his American Dreams
And no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway
Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up, now that I know what's at stake
Here
At the park where we used to sit on children's swings
Wearing imaginary rings
But it's gonna be alright, I did my time


You can beat the heat
If you beat the charges too
They said I was a cheat
I guess it must be true
And my friends all smell like weed or little babies
And this city reeks of driving myself crazy

Little did you know, your home's really only a town you're just a guest in
So you work your life away just to pay for a timeshare down in Destin

Florida!!!
Is one hell of a drug
Florida!!!
Can I use you up?

And the hurricane with my name, when it came
I got drunk and I dared it to wash me away
Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine
Well, me and my ghosts, we had a hell of a time
Yes, I'm haunted, but I'm feeling just fine
All my girls got their lace and their crimes
And your cheating husband disappeared, well
No one asks any questions here
So I did my best to lay to rest
All of the bodies that have ever been on my body
And in my mind, they sink into the swamp
Is that a bad thing to say in a song?

Little did you know, your home's really only the town you'll get arrested
So you pack your life away just to wait out the shitstorm back in Texas

Florida!!!
Is one hell of a drug
Florida!!!
Can I use you up?

I need to forget, so take me to Florida
I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida
Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable
At least the dolls are beautiful, fuck me up, Florida!

I need to forget, so take me to Florida
I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida
Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable
What a crash, what a rush, fuck me up, Florida!

It's one hell of a drug
It's one hell of a drug
Love left me like this
And I don't want to exist
So take me to Florida

Little did you know, your home's really only a town you're just a guest in
So you work your life away just to pay for a timeshare down in Destin (Take me to Florida)
Little did you know, your home's really only the town you'll get arrested (Take me to Florida)
So you pack your life away just to wait out the shitstorm back in Texas (Take me to)

Florida!!!
Is one hell of a drug
(Take me to) Florida!!!
Can I use you up?
Florida!!!
Is one hell of a drug
Florida!!!
Go on, fuck me up


Drowning in the Blue Nile
He sent me "Downtown Lights"
I hadn't heard it in a while
My boredom's bone-deep
This cage was once just fine
Am I allowed to cry?

I dream of cracking locks
Throwing my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks
Crashing into him tonight, he's a paradox
I'm seeing visions, am I bad?
Or mad? Or wise?

What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and falling back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touching his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

I keep these longings locked
In lowercase, inside a vault
Someone told me there's no such thing as bad thoughts
Only your actions talk

These fatal fantasies giving way to labored breath
Taking all of me, we've already done it in my head
If it's make-believe
Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?

What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and falling back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
My bedsheets are ablaze, I've screamed his name
Building up like waves crashing over my grave
Without ever touching his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

What if I roll the stone away?
They're gonna crucify me anyway
What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?
If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me
They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly
I choose you and me religiously

What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and falling back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touching his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

He sent me "Downtown Lights"
I hadn't heard it in a while
Am I allowed to cry?


The "Who's Who" of "Who's That?"
Is poised for the attack
But my bare hands paved their paths
You don't get to tell me about "sad"

If you wanted me dead
You should've just said
Nothing makes me feel more alive

So I leap from the gallows, and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
"Who's afraid of little old me?"
You should be

The scandal was contained
The bullet had just grazed
At all costs, keep your good name
You don't get to tell me you feel bad

Is it a wonder I broke? Let's hear one more joke
Then we could all just laugh until I cry

So I leap from the gallows, and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
"Who's afraid of little old me?"
I was tame, I was gentle till the circus life made me mean
Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth
Who's afraid of little old me?
Well, you should be, you should be, you should be (You should be, you should be)
You should be, you should be, you should be (You should be, you should be)

So tell me everything is not about me
But what if it is?
Then say they didn't do it to hurt me
But what if they did?
I want to snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me
You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me
So all you kids can sneak into my house, with all the cobwebs
I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?

That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn
That I'm fearsome, and I'm wretched, and I'm wrong
Put narcotics into all of my songs
And that's why you're still singing along

So I leap from the gallows, and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
"Who's afraid of little old me?"
I was tame, I was gentle till the circus life made me mean
Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth
Who's afraid of little old me?
Well, you should be, you should be, you should be (You should be, you should be)

'Cause you lured me, and you hurt me, and you taught me (You should be, you should be)
You caged me, and then you called me crazy
I am what I am 'cause you trained me
So who's afraid of me?
So who's afraid of little old me?
Who's afraid of little old me?


The smoke cloud billows out his mouth
Like a freight train through a small town
The jokes that he told across the bar
Were revolting and far too loud

They shake their heads, saying, "God help her" when I
Tell 'em he's my man
But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger
I can fix him, no really I can
And only I can

The dopamine races through his brain
On a six-lane Texas highway
His hand, so calloused from his pistol
Softly traces hearts on my face
And I could see it from a mile away
A perfect case for my certain skillset
He had a halo of the highest grade
He just hadn't met me yet

They shake their heads, saying, "God help her" when I
Tell 'em he's my man
But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger
I can fix him, no really I can
And only I can

Good boy, that's right
Come close, I'll show you heaven
If you'll be an angel all night
Trust me, I can handle me a dangerous man
No really I can

They shook their heads, saying, "God help her" when I
Told 'em he's my man (I told 'em he's my man)
But your good Lord didn't need to lift a finger
I can fix him, no really I can (No really I can)

Whoa, maybe I can't


Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
If we know the steps anyway?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
Stitching, "We were just kids, babe"
I said, "I don't mind, it takes time"
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since

If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
You and I go from one kiss to getting married
Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
Never quite buried
In your suit and tie, in the nick of time
You lowdown boy, you standup guy, you
Holy Ghost, you told me I'm
The love of your life

You said I'm the love of your life
About a million times

Who's gonna tell me the truth, when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your Impressionist paintings of Heaven turned out to be fakes
Well, you took me to hell too
And all at once, the ink bleeds
A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
But I felt a hole like this
Never before and ever since

If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
What we thought was for all time was momentary
Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
Never quite buried
You cinephile in black and white
All those plot twists and dynamite
Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry
You said I'm the love of your life

You shit-talked me under the table, talking rings and talking cradles
I wish I could un-recall how we almost had it all
Dancing phantoms on the terrace, are they second-hand embarrassed
That I can't get out of bed 'cause something counterfeit's dead?
It was legendary
It was momentary
It was unnecessary, should've let it stay buried

Oh, what a valiant roar
What a bland goodbye
The coward claimed he was a lion
I'm combing through the braids of lies
"I'll never leave"
"Never mind"
Our field of dreams, engulfed in fire
Your arson's match, your somber eyes
And I'll still see it until I die
You're the loss of my life


I can read your mind
"She's having the time of her life"
There in her glittering prime
The lights refract sequin stars
Off her silhouette every night
I can show you lies

'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, "Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"
And I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
Even when you want to die
He said he'd love me all his life
But that life was too short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the pieces of me shattered
As the crowd was chanting "More!"
I was grinning like I'm winning
I was hitting my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart

I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday
Every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me
Like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive
It's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart

I can hold my breath
I've been doing it since he left
I keep finding his things in drawers
Crucial evidence, I didn't imagine the whole thing
I'm sure I can pass this test

'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, "Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"
And I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
In stilettos for miles
He said he'd love me for all time
But that time was quite short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the pieces of me shattered
As the crowd was chanting "More!"
I was grinning like I'm winning
I was hitting my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart

I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday
Every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me
Like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive
It's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart

You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
You know you're good, and I'm good
'Cause I'm miserable!
And nobody even knows!
Try and come for my job


Was any of it true?
Gazing at me starry-eyed
In your Jehovah's Witness suit
Who the fuck was that guy?
You tried to buy some pills
From a friend of friends of mine
They just ghosted you
Now you know what it feels like

And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?

You hung me on your wall
Stabbed me with your push pins
In public, showed me off
Then sank in stoned oblivion
'Cause once your queen had come
You'd treat her like an also-ran
You didn't measure up
In any measure of a man

And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?

Were you sent by someone
Who wanted me dead?
Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?
Were you writing a book?
Were you a sleeper cell spy?
In fifty years will all this be declassified?
And you'll confess why you did it
And I'll say, "Good riddance"
'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden
I would've died for your sins
Instead I just died inside
And you deserve prison, but you won't get time
You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars
You crashed my party and your rental car
You said normal girls were "boring"
But you were gone by the morning
You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing
And in plain sight you hid
But you are what you did
And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive
The smallest man who ever lived


This happens once every few lifetimes
These chemicals hit me like white wine

What if I told you I'm back?
The hospital was a drag
Worst sleep that I ever had
I circled you on a map
I haven't come around in so long
But I'm coming back so strong

So when I
Touch down, call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
Ditch the clowns, get the crown, baby, I'm the one to beat
'Cause the sign on your heart said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?

Hey, you
What if I told you we're cool?
That child's play back in school is forgiven under my rule
I haven't come around in so long
But I'm making a comeback to where I belong

So when I
Touch down, call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
Ditch the clowns, get the crown, baby, I'm the one to beat
'Cause the sign on your heart said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?

These blokes warm the benches, we been on a winning streak
He jokes that it's heroin but this time with an "E"
'Cause the sign on your heart said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?

Shirts off, and your friends lift you up over their heads
Beer sticking to the floor, cheers chanted 'cause they said
There was no chance, tryna be the greatest in the league
Where's the trophy?
He just comes running over to me

Touch down, call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
Ditch the clowns, get the crown, baby, I'm the one to beat
'Cause the sign on your heart said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?

These blokes warm the benches, we been on a winning streak
He jokes that it's heroin but this time with an "E"
'Cause the sign on your heart said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?

This happens once every few lifetimes
These chemicals hit me like white wine


"You look like Clara Bow
In this light, remarkable
All your life, did you know
You'd be picked like a rose?"

"I'm not trying to exaggerate
But I think I might die if it happened
Die if it happened to me
No one in my small town
Thought I'd see the lights of Manhattan"

"This town is fake, but you're the real thing
Breath of fresh air through smoke rings
Take the glory, give everything
Promise to be dazzling"

"You look like Stevie Nicks
In '75, the hair and lips
Crowd goes wild at her fingertips
Half moonshine, a full eclipse"

"I'm not trying to exaggerate
But I think I might die if I made it
Die if I made it
No one in my small town
Thought I'd meet these suits in L.A.
They all wanna say"

"This town is fake, but you're the real thing
Breath of fresh air through smoke rings
Take the glory, give everything
Promise to be dazzling"

"The crown is stained, but you're the real queen
Flesh and blood amongst war machines
You're the new God we're worshipping
Promise to be dazzling"

Beauty is a beast that roars
Down on all fours
Demanding, "More"
Only when your girlish glow
Flickers just so
Do they let you know?
It's hell on earth to be heavenly
Them's the breaks, they don't come gently

"You look like Taylor Swift
In this light, we're loving it
You've got edge she never did
The future's bright, dazzling"


I am someone who, until recent events
You shared your secrets with
And your location
You forgot to turn it off
And so I watch as you walk
Into some bar called The Black Dog
And pierce new holes in my heart
You forgot to turn it off
And it hits me
I just don't understand

How you don't miss me
In The Black Dog
When someone plays 'The Starting Line' and you jump up
But she's too young to know this song
That was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming
Old habits die screaming

I move through the world with the heartbroken
My longings stay unspoken
And I may never open up the way I did for you
And all of those best laid plans
You said I needed a brave man
Then proceeded to play him
Until I believed it too
And it kills me
I just don't understand

How you don't miss me
In the shower
And remember
How my rain-soaked body was shaking
Do you hate me?
Was it hazing?
For a cruel fraternity I pledged
And I still mean it
Old habits die screaming

Six weeks of breathing clean air
I still miss the smoke
Were you making fun of me with some esoteric joke?
Now I want to sell my house and set fire to all my clothes
And hire a priest to come and exorcize my demons
Even if I die screaming
And I hope you hear it

And I hope it's shitty
In The Black Dog
When someone plays The Starting Line and you jump up
But she's too young to know this song
That was intertwined in the tragic fabric of our dreaming
'Cause tail between your legs you're leaving
And I still can't believe it
'Cause old habits die screaming


Lilac short skirt
The one that fits me like skin
Did your research
You knew the price goin' in

And I'll tell you one thing, honey
I can tell when somebody still wants me, come clean
Standing at the bar like something's funny, bubbly
Once you fix your face, I'm goin' in

Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
Gonna smash up your bike, I
Haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back

Whether I'm gonna curse you out or
Take you back to my house, I
Haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back

I hear the whispers in your eyes
I'll make you wanna think twice
You'll find that you were never not mine
You're mine

Small talk, big love
Act like I don't care what you did
I'm an Aston Martin
That you steered straight into the ditch
Then ran and hid

And I'll tell you one thing, honey
I can take the upper hand and touch your body
Flip the script and leave you like a dumb house party
Or I might just love you 'til the end

Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
Gonna smash up your bike, I
Haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back

Whether I'm gonna flip you off or
Pull you into the closet
I haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back

I hear the whispers in your eyes
I'll make you wanna think twice, you'll find
That you were never not mine
You're mine

I can feel it comin', hummin' in the way you move
Push the reset button, we're becoming something new
Say you got somebody, I'll say, "I got someone too"
Even if it's handcuffed, I'm leaving here with you

Bygones will be bygone eras fadin' into gray
We broke all the pieces but still want to play the game
Told my friends, "I hate you but I love you just the same"
Pick your poison, babe
I'm poison either way

Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
Gonna smash up your bike, I
Haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back

Whether I'm gonna curse you out or
Take you back to my house, I
Haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back

I hear the whispers in your eyes
I'll make you wanna think twice
You'll find that you were never not mine
I'm gonna get you back


Wise men once said
"Wild winds are death to the candle"
A rose by any other name is a scandal
Cautions issued, he stood
Shooting the messengers
They tried to warn him about her

Cross your thoughtless heart
Only liquor anoints you
She's the albatross
She is here to destroy you

Wise men once said
"One bad seed kills the garden"
"One less temptress
One less dagger to sharpen"
Locked me up in towers
But I'd visit in your dreams
And they tried to warn you about me

Cross your thoughtless heart
Only liquor anoints you
She's the albatross
She is here to destroy you
Devils that you know
Raise worse hell than a stranger
She's the death you chose
You're in terrible danger

And when that sky rains fire on you
And you're persona non grata
I'll tell you how I've been there too
And that none of it matters

Wise men once read fake news
And they believed it
Jackals raised their hackles
You couldn't conceive it
You were sleeping soundly when they dragged you from your bed
And I tried to warn you about them

So I crossed my thoughtless heart
Spread my wings like a parachute
I'm the albatross
I swept in at the rescue
The devil that you know
Looks now more like an angel
I'm the life you chose
And all this terrible danger

So cross your thoughtless heart
She's the albatross
She is here to destroy you


Your hologram stumbled into my apartment
Hands in the hair of somebody in darkness
Named Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus
And I just watched it happen
As the decade would play us for fools
And you saw my bones out with somebody new
Who seemed like he would've bullied you in school
And you just watched it happen

If you want to break my cold, cold heart
Just say, "I loved you the way that you were"
If you want to tear my world apart
Just say you've always wondered

You said some things that I can't unabsorb
You turned me into an idea of sorts
You needed me, but you needed drugs more
And I couldn't watch it happen
I changed into goddesses, villains, and fools
Changed plans and lovers and outfits and rules
All to outrun my desertion of you
And you just watched it

If you want to break my cold, cold heart
Just say, "I loved you the way that you were"
If you want to tear my world apart
Just say you've always wondered

If the glint in my eye traced the depths of your sigh
Down that passage in time
Back to the moment I crashed into you
Like so many wrecks do
Too impaired by my youth
To know what to do

So if I sell my apartment
And you have some kids with an internet starlet
Will that make your memory fade from this scarlet maroon?
Like it never happened
Could it be enough to just float in your orbit?
Can we watch our phantoms like watching wild horses?
Cooler in theory, but not if you force it
To be, it just didn't happen

So if you want to break my cold, cold heart
Say you loved me
And if you want to tear my world apart
Say you'll always wonder

'Cause I wonder
Will I always
Will I always wonder?


We hereby conduct this post mortem
He was a hothouse flower to my outdoorsman
Our maladies were such we could not cure them
And so a touch that was my birthright became foreign

Come one, come all
It's happening again
The empathetic hunger descends
We'll tell no one except all of our friends
We must know
How did it end?

We were blind to unforeseen circumstances
We learned the right steps to different dances
And fell victim to interlopers' glances
Lost the game of chance, what are the chances?
Soon they'll go home to their husbands
Smug 'cause they know they can trust him
Then feverishly calling their cousins

Guess who we ran into at the shops
Walking in circles like she was lost
Didn't you hear they called it all off
One gasp, and then
How did it end?

Say it once again with feeling
How the death rattle breathing
Silenced as the soul was leaving
The deflation of our dreaming
Leaving me bereft and reeling
My beloved ghost and me
Sitting in a tree
D-Y-I-N-G

It's happening again
How did it end?
I can't pretend like I understand
How did it end?

Come one, come all
It's happening again
The empathetic hunger descends
We'll tell no one except all of our friends
But I still don't know
How did it end?


I feel so high school
Every time I look at you
I want to find you in a crowd
Just to hide from you

And in the blink of a crinklin' eye
I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined
Cheeks pink in the twinklin' lights
Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
I'll drink what you think and I'm high
From smokin' your jokes all damn night
The brink of a wrinkle in time
Bittersweet sixteen suddenly
I'm watchin' American Pie with you on a Saturday night
Your friends are around, so be quiet
I'm tryin' to stifle my sighs
'Cause I feel so high school
Every time I look at you
But look at you

Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me?
Kill me
It's just a game, but really
Really
I'm bettin' on all three for us two
All three
Get my car door, isn't that sweet
That sweet
Then pull me to the backseat
Backseat
No one's ever had me, not like you
Had me

Truth, dare, spin bottles
You know how to ball, I know Aristotle
Brand new, full throttle
Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto
It's true, swear, scouts honor
You knew what you wanted, and, boy, you got her
Brand new, full throttle
You already know, babe

I feel like laughin'
In the middle of practice
Do that impression you did of your dad again
I'm hearin' voices, like a madman

And in the blink of a crinklin' eye
I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined
Cheeks pink in the twinklin' lights
Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
I'll drink what you think and I'm high
From smokin' your jokes all damn night
The brink of a wrinkle in time
Bittersweet sixteen suddenly
I'm watching American Pie with you on a Saturday night
Your friends are around, so be quiet
I'm tryin' to stifle my sighs
'Cause I feel so high school
Every time I look at you
But look at you

Truth, dare, spin bottles
You know how to ball, I know Aristotle
Brand new, full throttle
Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto
It's true, swear, scouts honor
You knew what you wanted, and, boy, you got her
Brand new, full throttle
You already know, babe
You already know, babe


Quick, quick
Tell me something awful
Like you are a poet
Trapped inside the body of a finance guy
Tell me all your secrets
All you'll ever be is
My eternal consolation prize
You see I was a debutant
In another life, but
Now I seem to be scared to go outside
If comfort is a construct
I don't believe in good luck
Now that I know what's what

I hate it here so I will go to
Secret gardens in my mind
People need a key to get to
The only one is mine
I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child
No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
I hate it here

My friends used to play a game where
We would pick a decade
We wished we could live in instead of this
I'd say the 1830s but without all the racists and getting married off for the highest bid
Everyone would look down
'Cause it wasn't fun now
Seems like it was never even fun back then
Nostalgia is a mind's trick
If I'd been there, I'd hate it
It was freezing in the palace

I hate it here so I will go to
Lunar valleys in my mind
When they found a better planet
Only the gentle survived
I dreamed about it in the dark
The night I felt like I might die
No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
I hate it here

I'm lonely, but I'm good
I'm bitter, but I swear I'm fine
I'll save all my romanticism for my inner life and I'll get lost on purpose
This place made me feel worthless
Lucid dreams like electricity, the current flies through me and in my fantasies I rise above it
And way up there, I actually love it

I hate it here so I will go to
Secret gardens in my mind
People need a key to get to
The only one is mine
I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child
No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
I hate it here

Quick, quick
Tell me something awful
Like you are a poet
Trapped inside the body of a finance guy


When I picture my hometown
There's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you
And a plaque underneath it
That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school
And it was always the same searing pain
But I dreamed that one day I could say

All that time you were throwin' punches
I was buildin' somethin'
And I can't forgive the way you made me feel
Screamed, 'fucK you aIMee' to the night sky
As the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal

And it wasn't a fair fight
Or a clean Kill
Each time that aIMee stomped across my grave
And then she wrote headlines
In the local paper laughing at each baby step I'd take
And it was always the same searing pain
But I prayed that one day I could say

All that time you were throwin' punches
I was buildin' somethin'
And I couldn't wait to show you it was real
Screamed 'fucK you aIMee' to the night sky
As the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
I pushed each boulder up the hill
Your words are still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head

I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool
I built a legacy that you can't undo
But when I count the scars
There's a moment of truth
That there wouldn't be this
If there hadn't been you

And maybe you've reframed it
And in your mind you never beat my spirit black and blue
I don't think you've changed much
And so I changed your name and any real defining clues
And one day
Your kid comes home singing
A song that only us two is gonna know is about you
'Cause

All that time you were throwin' punches
It was all for nothin'
And our town it looks so small from way up here
Screamed, 'thanK you aIMee' to the night sky
And the stars are stunnin'
'Cause I can't forget the way you made me heal
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
So I pushed each boulder up that hill
Your words were still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head
ThanK you aIMee
ThanK you aIMee


I had died the tiniest death
I spied the catch in your breath
Out, out, out, out, out, out
Northbound I got carried away
As you boarded your train
South, south, south, south, south, south
A feather taken by the wind blowing
I'm afflicted by the not knowing so

I look in people's windows
Transfixed by rose golden glows
They have their friends over to drink nice wine
I look in people's windows
In case you're at their table
What if your eyes looked up and met mine
One more time

You had stopped and tilted your head
I still ponder what it meant
Now, now, now, now, now, now
I tried searching faces on streets
What are the chances you'd be
Downtown, downtown, downtown
Does it feel alright to not know me?
I'm addicted to the "if only"

So I look in people's windows
Like I'm some deranged weirdo
I attend Christmas parties from outside
I look in people's windows
In case you're at their table
What if your eyes looked up and met mine
One more time


Hand on the throttle
Thought I caught lightning in a bottle
Oh, but it's gone again
And it was written
I got cursed like Eve got bitten
Oh, was it punishment?
Pad around when I get home
I guess a lesser woman would've lost hope
A greater woman wouldn't beg
But I looked to the sky and said

Please
I've been on my knees
Change the prophecy
Don't want money
Just someone who wants my company
Let it once be me
Who do I have to speak to
About if they can redo
The prophecy?

Cards on the table
Mine play out like fools in a fable, oh
It was sinking in
Sinking in, oh
Slow is the quicksand
Poison blood from the wound of the pricked hand
Oh, still I dream of him

Please
I've been on my knees
Change the prophecy
Don't want money
Just someone who wants my company
Let it once be me
Who do I have to speak to
About if they can redo
The prophecy?

And I sound like an infant
Feelin' like the very last drops of an ink pen
A greater woman stays cool
But I howl like a wolf at the moon
And I look unstable
Gathered with a coven round a sorceress' table
A greater woman has faith
But even statues crumble if they're made to wait
I'm so afraid I sealed my fate
No sign of soulmates
I'm just a paperweight
In shades of greige
Spending my last coin so someone will tell me
It'll be ok
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Please
I've been on my knees
Change the prophecy
Don't want money
Just someone who wants my company
Let it once be me
Who do I have to speak to
About if they can redo
The prophecy?

Who do I have to speak to
To change the prophecy?
Hand on the throttle
Thought I caught lightning in a bottle, oh
But it's gone again
Pad around when I get home
I guess a lesser woman would've lost hope
A greater woman wouldn't beg
But I looked to the sky and said
Please


I was in my new house placing daydreams
Patching up the crack along the wall
I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying
'Cause that's where I was when I got the call

When the first stone's thrown there's screamin'
In the streets there's a ragin' riot
When it's, "Burn the bitch", they're shrieking
When the truth comes out it's quiet

So they killed Cassandra first
'Cause she feared the worst
And tried to tell the town
So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say
Do you believe me now?

I was in my tower weaving nightmares
Twisting all my smiles into snarls
They say what doesn't kill you makes you aware
What happens if it becomes who you are?

So they killed Cassandra first
'Cause she feared the worst
And tried to tell the town
So they set my life in flames, I regret to say
Do you believe me now?

They knew, they knew, they knew the whole time
That I was onto somethin'
The family, the pure greed, the Christian chorus line
They all said nothin'

Blood's thick, but nothin' like a payroll
Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul
You can mark my words that I said it first
In a mourning warning no one heard

I patched up the crack along the wall
I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying
'Cause that's where I was when I lost it all

So they killed Cassandra first
'Cause she feared the worst
And tried to tell the town
So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say
Do you believe me now?

I was onto somethin'
They all said nothin'
Blood's thick, but nothin' like a payroll
Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul
You can mark my words that I said it first
In a mourning warning no one heard

No one heard
Not a single word was heard

When the first stone's thrown there's screamin'
In the streets there's a ragin' riot
When it's "Burn the bitch", they're shriekin'
When the truth comes out it's quiet
It's so quiet


Forgive me, Peter
My lost fearless leader
In closets like cedar
Preserved from when we were just kids
Is it somethin' I did?
The goddess of timing
Once found us beguiling
She said she was trying
Peter, was she lying?
My ribs get the feelin' she did
And I didn't want to come down
I thought it was just goodbye for now

You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes
Promises oceans deep
But never to keep
Oh, never to keep

Are you still a mind reader?
A natural scene stealer?
I've heard great things, Peter
But life was always easier on you
Than it was on me
And sometimes it gets me
When crossing your jet stream
We both did the best we could do underneath the same moon
In different galaxies
And I didn't want to hang around
We said it was just goodbye for now

You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes
Promises oceans deep
But never to keep
Never to keep

And I won't confess that I waited
But I let the lamp burn
As the men masqueraded
I hoped you'd return
With your feet on the ground
Tell me all that you'd learned
'Cause love's never lost when perspective is earned
And you said you'd come and get me, but you were twenty-five
And the shelf life of those fantasies has expired
Lost to the Lost Boys chapter of your life
Forgive me, Peter, please know that I tried
To hold onto the days when you were mine (Hold onto the days)
But the woman who sits by the window has turned out the light

You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes
Promises oceans deep
But never to keep


By all accounts, she almost drowned
When she was six in frigid water
And I can confirm she made
A curious child, ever reviled
By everyone except her own father
With a quite bewitching face
Splendidly selfish, charmingly helpless
Excellent fun till you get to know her
Then she runs like it's a race
Behind her back, her best mates laughed
And they nicknamed her The Bolter

Started with a kiss
"Oh, we must stop meeting like this"
But it always ends up with a town car speeding
Out the drive one evening
Ended with the slam of a door
Then he'll call her a whore
Wish he wouldn't be sore
But as she was leaving
It felt like breathing
All her fuckin' lives
Flashed before her eyes
It feels like the time
She fell through the ice
Then came out alive

He was a cad, wanted her bad
Just like any good trophy hunter
And she liked the way it tastes
Taming a bear, making him care
Watching him jump then pulling him under
And at first blush, this is fate
When it's all roses, portrait poses
Central Park Lake in tiny rowboats
What a charming Saturday
That's when she sees the littlest leaks
Down in the floorboards
And she just knows
She must bolt

Started with a kiss
"Oh, we must stop meeting like this"
But it always ends up with a town car speeding
Out the drive one evening
Ended with the slam of a door
Then he'll call her a whore
Wish he wouldn't be sore
But as she was leaving
It felt like breathing
All her fuckin' lives
Flashed before her eyes
It feels like the time
She fell through the ice
Then came out alive

She's been many places with
Men of many faces
First they're off to the races
And she's laughing drawin' aces
But, none of it is changin'
That the chariot is waitin'
Hearts are hers for the breakin'
There's escape in escaping

Started with a kiss
"Oh, we must stop meeting like this"
But it always ends with a town car speeding
Out the drive one evenin'
Ended with the slam of a door
But she's got the best stories
You can be sure
That as she was leaving
It felt like freedom
All her fuckin' lives
Flashed before her eyes
And she realized
It feels like the time
She fell through the ice
Then came out alive


Long may you reign
You're an animal
You are bloodthirsty
Out window panes talking utter nonsense
You have no idea

Strings tied to levers
Slowed-down clocks tethered
All this showmanship
To keep it for you
In sweetness
Way to go, tiger
Higher and higher
Wilder and lighter
For you

Long may you roar
At your dinosaurs
You're a just ruler
Covered in mud, you look ridiculous
And you have no idea

Buried down deep and out of your reach
The secret we all vowed
To keep it from you
In sweetness
Way to go, tiger
Higher and higher
Wilder and lighter
For you

You got the dragonflies above your bed
You have a favorite spot on the swing set
You have no room in your dreams for regrets
You have no idea
The time will arrive for the cruel and the mean
You'll learn to bounce back just like your trampoline
But now we'll curtail your curiosity
In sweetness

Way to go, tiger
Way to go, tiger
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Wilder and lighter
For you


Now and then she re-reads the manuscript
Of the entire torrid affair
They compared their licenses
He said, "I'm not a donor but
I'd give you my heart if you needed it"
She rolled her eyes and said, "You're a professional"
He said, "No, just a Good Samaritan"
He said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation was
Soon they'd be pushing strollers
But soon it was over

In the age of him she wished she was thirty
And made coffee every morning in a French press
Afterward she only ate kids' cereal
And couldn't sleep unless it was in her mother's bed
Then she dated boys who were her own age
With dartboards on the backs of their doors
She thought about how he said
Since she was so wise beyond her years
Everything had been above board
She wasn't sure

And the years passed like scenes of a show
The professor said to write what you know
Looking backwards might be the only way
To move forward
Then the actors were hitting their marks
And the slow dance was alight with the sparks
And the tears fell in synchronicity with the score
And at last
She knew what the agony had been for

The only thing that's left is the manuscript
One last souvenir from my trip to your shores
Now and then I re-read the manuscript
But the story isn't mine anymore
